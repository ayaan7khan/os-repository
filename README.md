Overview

Definition: A Virtual OS Simulator is a software tool that replicates core functionalities of an operating system in a virtual environment, allowing users to explore OS concepts without real hardware.
Purpose: The project aims to simulate essential OS operations like process management, memory allocation, and CPU scheduling, serving as an educational or experimental tool.

Key Features:
Simulates process creation, execution, and termination with unique IDs and states.
Implements scheduling algorithms (e.g., Round Robin, FCFS) to manage process execution order.
Manages virtual memory allocation and deallocation, tracking usage.
Includes a basic file system for operations like file creation and deletion.
Offers a user interface (CLI or GUI) for interaction.


Scope: Focuses on simplified OS components, avoiding real hardware interaction, and targets a subset of functionalities for learning purposes.
Design: Built around a kernel simulator, process control blocks, a scheduler, memory manager, and file system module, coded in a language like Python or C++.
Benefits: Provides hands-on understanding of OS principles, such as multitasking and resource management, in a risk-free setting.
Limitations: Lacks real-time hardware integration and full OS complexity, keeping it lightweight and educational.
Applications: Useful for students, hobbyists, or developers learning OS design basics.
Future Potential: Can be enhanced with advanced algorithms, visualizations, or virtual hardware simulation.
This project demonstrates OS fundamentals effectively while remaining accessible and practical.
